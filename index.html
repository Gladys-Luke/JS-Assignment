        Hi, my name is Gladys Luke and I'm a web developer based in Abuja. I'm
        passionate about creating elegant and efficient websites that deliver a
        great user experience. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have
        experience working on projects for clients in various industries. When
        I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking. I'm excited to continue learning and
        growing as a developer, and I'm always on the lookout for new
        challenges."
